# Jules PR Comment Action

[![Built with Jules](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Jules-715cd7?link=https://jules.google)](https://jules.google)

This GitHub Action posts a comment on a Pull Request with details from an associated [Jules](https://jules.google) session. It detects the Jules session ID from the PR description, fetches session details and artifacts (like media), and posts a summary comment.

**Note:** This only works for tasks started from the account associated with the Jules API key stored in your repo secrets.

## Prerequisites

Before using this action, you must have:

1.  **Authenticated with GitHub at [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com).**
2.  **A Jules API Key:** Generate an API key from your Jules account settings. For more information, see the [Jules API documentation](https://developers.google.com/jules/api).
3.  **Stored the API key as a secret:** You will need to add this as a secret in your GitHub repository. For more information, see the [GitHub documentation on using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
